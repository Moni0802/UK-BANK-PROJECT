KEY INSIGHTS:
ðŸš€My First latest POWER BI ðŸ“Š project on Bank Customers analysis!
Some Key Insights are : 
ðŸ”¹The average customer age is 34.99, but the distribution of balances is heavily skewed, with a significant portion of customers in the 20-40 age group holding the majority of the balance.
ðŸ”¹The majority of the bank's customer base is classified as 'White Collar,' followed by 'Blue Collar'â€”a key insight for targeted marketing and product development.
ðŸ”¹While the customer base is almost evenly split by gender (51.57% Male vs. 48.43% Female), there are noticeable differences in the distribution of balances, particularly in the older age groups.
